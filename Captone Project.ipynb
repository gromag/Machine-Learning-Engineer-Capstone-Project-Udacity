    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"rubric\">Student provides a high-level overview of the project in layman’s terms. Background information such as the problem domain, the project origin, and related data sets or input data is given.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing is a complex field which is hypothesised to be part of AI-complete set of problems, implying that the difficulty of these computational problems is equivalent to that of solving the central artificial intelligence problem making computers as intelligent as people.[$^{[cit.Wikipedia]}$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI-complete)\n",
    "\n",
    "With over 90% of data ever generated being produced in the last 2 years[$^{[ref.ScienceDaily]}$](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/05/130522085217.htm) and with a great proportion being human generated unstructured text there is an ever increasing need to advance the field of Natural Language Processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent UK Government proposal to have measures to regulate social media companies over harmful content, including \"substantial\" fines and the ability to block services that do not stick to the rules is an example of the regulamentory need to better manage the content that is being generated by users. [$^{[ref.BBC]}$](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-47135058)\n",
    "\n",
    "Other initiatives like [Riot Games](https://www.riotgames.com/en)'s work aimed to predict and reform toxic player behaviour during games[$^{[ref.ArsTechnica]}$](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/05/using-science-to-reform-toxic-player-behavior-in-league-of-legends/) is another example of this effort to understand the content being generated by users and moderate toxic content.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as highlighted by the Kaggle competition [Jigsaw unintended bias in toxicity classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/overview), existing models suffer from unintended bias where models might predict high likelihood of toxicity for content containing certain words (e.g. \"gay\") even when those comments were not actually toxic (such as \"I am a gay woman\"), leaving  machine only classification models still sub-standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having tools that are able to flag up toxic content without suffering from unintended bias is of paramount importance to preserve Internet's fairness and freedom of speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"rubric\">The problem which needs to be solved is clearly defined. <span class=\"warn\">A strategy for solving the problem, including discussion of the expected solution, has been made.</span></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "From [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/overview) competition page:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Conversation AI team, a research initiative founded by Jigsaw and Google (both part of Alphabet), builds technology to protect voices in conversation. A main area of focus is machine learning models that can identify toxicity in online conversations, where toxicity is defined as anything rude, disrespectful or otherwise likely to make someone leave a discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last year, in the Toxic Comment Classification Challenge, participants built multi-headed models to recognize toxicity and several subtypes of toxicity. This year's competition is a related challenge: building toxicity models that operate fairly across a diverse range of conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the background: When the Conversation AI team first built toxicity models, they found that the models incorrectly learned to associate the names of frequently attacked identities with toxicity. Models predicted a high likelihood of toxicity for comments containing those identities (e.g. \"gay\"), even when those comments were not actually toxic (such as \"I am a gay woman\"). This happens because training data was pulled from available sources where unfortunately, certain identities are overwhelmingly referred to in offensive ways. Training a model from data with these imbalances risks simply mirroring those biases back to users.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this competition, you're challenged to build a model that recognizes toxicity and minimizes this type of unintended bias with respect to mentions of identities. You'll be using a dataset labeled for identity mentions and optimizing a metric designed to measure unintended bias. Develop strategies to reduce unintended bias in machine learning models, and you'll help the Conversation AI team, and the entire industry, build models that work well for a wide range of conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"rubric\">Metrics used to measure performance of a model or result are clearly defined. Metrics are justified based on the characteristics of the problem.<span>\n",
    "\n",
    "This competition uses a newly developed metric that combines several submetrics to balance overall performance with various aspects of unintended bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please refer to [evaluation section](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/overview/evaluation) of the competition and the provided [benchmark kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/dborkan/benchmark-kernel) with code to calculate the competition evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are defined the submetrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall AUC\n",
    "This is the ROC-AUC for the full evaluation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bias AUCs\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure unintended bias, we again calculate the ROC-AUC, this time on three specific subsets of the test set for each identity, each capturing a different aspect of unintended bias. You can learn more about these metrics in Conversation AI's recent paper *[Nuanced Metrics for Measuring Unintended Bias with Real Data in Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04561)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Subgroup AUC:** Here, we restrict the data set to only the examples that mention the specific identity subgroup. *A low value in this metric means the model does a poor job of distinguishing between toxic and non-toxic comments that mention the identity*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**BPSN (Background Positive, Subgroup Negative) AUC:** Here, we restrict the test set to the non-toxic examples that mention the identity and the toxic examples that do not. *A low value in this metric means that the model confuses non-toxic examples that mention the identity with toxic examples that do not*, likely meaning that the model predicts higher toxicity scores than it should for non-toxic examples mentioning the identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**BNSP (Background Negative, Subgroup Positive) AUC:** Here, we restrict the test set to the toxic examples that mention the identity and the non-toxic examples that do not. *A low value here means that the model confuses toxic examples that mention the identity with non-toxic examples that do not*, likely meaning that the model predicts lower toxicity scores than it should for toxic examples mentioning the identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generalized Mean of Bias AUCs\n",
    "\n",
    "To combine the per-identity Bias AUCs into one overall measure, we calculate their generalized mean as defined below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$M_p(m_s)=( \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{s=1}^{N}m_{s}^{p} )^{\\frac{1}{p}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "MpMp = the ppth power-mean function\\\n",
    "msms = the bias metric mm calulated for subgroup ss\\\n",
    "NN = number of identity subgroups\n",
    "\n",
    "For this competition, we use a pp value of -5 to encourage competitors to improve the model for the identity subgroups with the lowest model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "We combine the overall AUC with the generalized mean of the Bias AUCs to calculate the final model score:\n",
    "\n",
    "$score=w_0AUC_{overall}+\\sum_{a=1}^{A}w_aM_p(m_{s,a})$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $A$ = number of submetrics (3)\n",
    "- $ms_{s,a}$ = bias metric for identity subgroup ss using submetric $a$\n",
    "$w_a$ = a weighting for the relative importance of each submetric; all four $w$ values set to 0.25\n",
    "\n",
    "While the leaderboard will be determined by this single number, we highly recommend looking at the individual submetric results, [as shown in this kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/dborkan/benchmark-kernel), to guide you as you develop your models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"rubric\">If a dataset is present, features and calculated statistics relevant to the problem have been reported and discussed, along with a sampling of the data.
